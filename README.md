# deep learning

A small repository for pulling together Deep Learning
algorithms and literature. Presently, the project will be
a image recognition project.

1. Project Proposal - Complete. 
2. References - In progress. 
3. Project Development - No progress. 
4. Functional Requirements - In progress.

Challenges: many of the algorithms used in image recognition
appear to be plumbing techniques.
